# RishikSimulator

## Developer(s)
- Dhruv Bhadauriya

## Description
- A first-person simulation of Dhruv Bhadauriya. We are planning to add a multiplayer feature in which players can go as Aneesh, Uday, John, etc.

## Architecture
- It will be built around a first-person model where the player will be able to see other players (or CPUs) while they play. This simulator is supposed to have multiple paths to success or fail, all dependent on the user's actions.
